# 🍼💥 BabyMash

**Let your baby smash the keyboard — colourful animations and happy sounds on every key — while keyboard shortcuts and trackpad gestures are blocked so they can't escape, close tabs, or wreck your desktop.**

A safe, open-source baby keyboard masher in the spirit of [tinyfingers.net](https://tinyfingers.net), but with stronger shortcut blocking (it uses the **Keyboard Lock API** to also grab `Cmd+W`, `Cmd+T`, `Cmd+Q`, `Esc`, and the F-keys in fullscreen — which most clones can't).

## Features

- 🎨 **Animated effects** — every key spawns a giant bouncing glyph plus a confetti burst on an HTML canvas.
- 🔊 **Procedural sound** — cheerful pentatonic tones generated with the WebAudio API (no audio files), with a little fanfare every 100 mashes.
- 🔒 **Shortcut blocking** — `preventDefault` on all keys/combos **plus** the [Keyboard Lock API](https://wicg.github.io/keyboard-lock/) to capture system shortcuts (`Cmd+W/T/Q/N/R`, `Esc`, F-keys) in fullscreen on Chrome/Edge.
- ✋ **Gesture blocking** — pinch-zoom, swipe navigation, text selection, right-click.
- 🚪 **Triple-tap ESC to quit** — configurable (2–6 consecutive presses) with an on-screen "press ESC X more times" counter, so a baby can't stumble out but a grown-up can.
- 📊 **Score & stats** — live mash counter, lifetime totals, best run, sessions (saved to `localStorage`), plus an optional **live worldwide counter** via Firebase Firestore.
- ⚙️ **Pre-flight toggles** — choose what to block *before* going fullscreen.

## What a web app can and can't block (important!)

Browsers run in a sandbox. Some macOS actions are intercepted by the OS **before any web page sees them**, so *no* website (including tinyfingers) can block them:

| Action | Blocked by BabyMash? |
|---|---|
| `Cmd+W` / `Cmd+T` / `Cmd+Q` / `Cmd+N` / `Cmd+R` | ✅ Yes (Chrome/Edge, fullscreen, Keyboard Lock) |
| `Esc`, `Tab`, F-keys (as keystrokes) | ✅ Yes |
| Right-click, pinch-zoom, text-select | ✅ Yes |
| **3/4-finger swipe between Spaces** | ❌ No — OS gesture |
| **`Cmd+Space` (Spotlight), `Cmd+Tab`** | ❌ No — OS-reserved |
| **`F3`/`F4` → Mission Control / Launchpad** | ❌ No — OS intercepts |

### Maximum lockdown on macOS

To stop the OS-level ones, change these once in **System Settings**:

- **Trackpad → More Gestures** — turn off *"Swipe between full-screen apps"* and *"Mission Control"*.
- **Keyboard → Keyboard Shortcuts → Mission Control** — uncheck the F3/F4 and Spaces shortcuts.
- **Keyboard Shortcuts → Spotlight** — uncheck `Cmd+Space`.
- Use **Chrome or Edge** (not Safari — Safari doesn't support the Keyboard Lock API).

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

Open the printed URL, click **Start Mashing** (a click is required so the browser allows fullscreen + audio).

## Build

```bash
npm run build      # outputs to dist/
npm run preview    # preview the production build
```

## Optional: Firebase (live worldwide counter)

The app works fully offline without Firebase. To enable the global counter and host it:

1. Create a Firebase project (e.g. `babymash-app`) at https://console.firebase.google.com.
2. **Build → Firestore Database → Create database** (production mode).
3. **Project settings → Your apps → Web** — register an app and copy the config.
4. `cp .env.example .env.local` and fill in the `VITE_FIREBASE_*` values.
5. Deploy:

```bash
npm install -g firebase-tools   # if needed
firebase login
firebase use --add              # pick your project, alias "default"
npm run build
firebase deploy                 # hosting + firestore rules
```

Firestore security rules (`firestore.rules`) lock the global doc down to *increment-only* on a single `mashes` field — no auth required, but it can't be vandalised with arbitrary writes.

## Desktop app (macOS) — stronger lockdown

The web version can't touch OS-level shortcuts. The bundled **Electron** app can:
it runs in kiosk mode and uses `globalShortcut` to swallow **Cmd+Space
(Spotlight)**, the **F-keys**, **Cmd+W/T/N/R/Q/H/M**, and the keyboard
Mission-Control / Spaces combos. Triple-tap **ESC** quits (set
`BABYMASH_EXIT_PRESSES` to change the count).

```bash
npm run electron:dev     # run the desktop app against the Vite dev server
npm run electron:build   # produce a signed-less .dmg in release/
```

The only thing even the desktop app can't intercept is the **3/4-finger
trackpad swipe** between Spaces (a WindowServer gesture) — turn it off once in
**System Settings → Trackpad → More Gestures** (see above). For a *hardware*
baby-lock with zero gestures, an **iPad in Guided Access** is unbeatable.

> First launch: the `.dmg` is unsigned, so right-click the app → **Open** the
> first time (or `xattr -dr com.apple.quarantine /Applications/BabyMash.app`).

## Continuous deployment (GitHub Actions)

`.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml` deploys to the live channel on every
push to `main`, and spins up an ephemeral preview channel for each pull request.

It needs **one** repo secret — a Firebase service account:

1. Firebase Console → **Project settings → Service accounts → Generate new private key**.
2. GitHub repo → **Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions → New repository secret**.
3. Name it `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_BABYMASH_APP`, paste the whole JSON.

(Or run `firebase init hosting:github` once, which creates the service account
and sets the secret for you.)
